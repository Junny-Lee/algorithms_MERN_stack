#  Bubble Sort


#  Selection Sort
Selection sort works by repeatedly "selecting" the next-smallest element from the unsorted array and moving it to the front.
- beginning array: unsorted
- Space: O(1)
- Time: 
    - worst: O(n^2)
    - best: O(n^2)
    - average: O(n^2)

#  Insertion Sort
Insertion sort works by inserting elements from an unsorted array into a sorted subsection of the array, one item at a time.
- beginning array: unsorted
- Space: O(1)
- Time: 
    - worst: O(n^2)
    - best: O(n)
    - average: O(n^2)
